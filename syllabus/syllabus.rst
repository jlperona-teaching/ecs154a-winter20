Websites
--------

GitHub
~~~~~~

We will use GitHub_ as the main website for the course.
It will also contain all of the documents for the course, such as labs, lecture notes, lecture outlines, the schedule, and the syllabus you're currently reading.

The versions of documents found on GitHub are the canonical versions of all documents.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first here on GitHub.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.

Canvas
~~~~~~

We will use Canvas_ for weekly quizzes, surveys, and as the gradebook.

Gradescope
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Gradescope_ for lab submissions, as well as for returning the midterm and the final.
Gradescope's autograder will give you quick feedback about your lab submissions.
For the exams, Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account at the start of the class.

Campuswire
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Campuswire_ for class discussions outside of the classroom.
It will serve as the discussion board for this quarter.
The TAs and I will be on Campuswire to answer questions.

On Campuswire, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TA or me.
Your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
Additionally, you may get a faster response from one of your classmates.
If you've used Piazza before, it's very similar, though it has some additional features (like the direct messaging) that I think are useful.

We will change the visibility of questions posted only to instructors to everyone, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.
The same applies to questions asked via direct message—we will ask you to repost to everyone if appropriate.
(It's in your interest to post to everyone due to the reputation system; see below.)

Campuswire has a reputation system.
The more you publicly contribute to the class on Campuswire, the higher your reputation becomes.
To encourage you to participate on Campuswire, you will get extra credit depending on the amount of reputation you have earned by the end of the course.
For more information, see the `Extra Credit`_ section.

Other Important Information
---------------------------

Regrade Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.
Instructions for requests will be given at the time of the return.

Accommodations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exam dates are available on the schedule_.
Per `official UC Davis policy`_, if you have an accommodation request from the `Student Disability Center`_, or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me by the **fourth class, Monday, 2020-01-13**.

Student Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as but not limited to:

* strained relationships
* increased anxiety
* alcohol/drug problems
* feeling down
* difficulty concentrating
* lack of motivation

These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities.

UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via `Student Health and Counseling Services`_.
In addition, you can learn about a variety of other resources for students at UC Davis on the `Pages tab of Canvas`_.

You can also direct message me on Campuswire_ to talk in private.

Academic Misconduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
Read the `Academic Misconduct Policy`_ of the Department of Computer Science for more detailed information on what constitutes academic misconduct.
Any violations of the `Code of Academic Conduct`_ will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the `Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs`_.

As it notes on the `main README`_ for this repository, public forks of this repository with assignment code in them abet cheating.
Any public forks with code in them will be considered academic misconduct.

The labs will allow for partners.
Feel free to share ideas with other groups.
You may not share code or circuits, however.
If you're looking at another group's code or circuits, odds are that you've gone past simply sharing ideas.

Assignments and Tests
---------------------

Grading Breakdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==================== ===
Labs (5x)            40%
Canvas Quizzes (10x) 10%
Midterm              20%
Final                30%
Extra Credit         5%
==================== ===

Labs
~~~~

You will complete five lab assignments throughout this course.
The labs and their due dates can be found in their respective folders on the main page of this GitHub_ repository.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade, though some labs may be weighted more than others.

For all labs, you are recommended to work with a partner, but it is not required.
You do not have to keep the same partner throughout the whole quarter; you can change who you work with.
I suggest using Campuswire_ to find partners.

Canvas Quizzes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There will be weekly quizzes on Canvas.
There are 10 quizzes; an individual quiz is worth approximately 1% of your overall grade.
Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

For each quiz, you get 5 attempts.
You can work on these quizzes by yourself or in groups of however many people you want.

The point of these quizzes isn't to test your knowledge or punish you for not paying attention in lecture.
They are meant to help you reinforce the material you've learned during the previous week.
They also serve as practice for the midterm and final.
I want everybody to get 100% on these quizzes and learn the material.

Late Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you turn in a lab late, you will lose points.
The percentage of points you will lose is given below, where *x* is the number of hours you are late.

* 0 ≤ *x* < 24: 85% credit
* 24 ≤ *x* < 48: 70% credit
* 48 ≤ *x*: no credit

This will give you partial points up to 48 hours after the due date.
This system is to encourage you to get some sleep and try again in the morning if you miss a deadline, rather than constantly working for hours after the deadline with no sleep as a linear drop-off system encourages.

Late quiz submissions will not be allowed.

Midterm
~~~~~~~

The midterm is on Friday, 2020-02-14, from 17:10 - 18:00.
The midterm covers content through 2020-02-12.

The midterm is closed-book and closed-note.
No asking your neighbors for help, and no electronic devices.

Final
~~~~~

The final is on Friday, 2020-03-20, from 10:30 - 12:30.
The final is cumulative, with emphasis placed on material after the midterm.

The final is closed-book and closed-note.
No asking your neighbors for help, and no electronic devices.

Extra Credit
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get up to 5% extra credit in the course.
This is a bit more than half a letter grade.
You can earn extra credit in the following ways:

Campuswire Reputation
"""""""""""""""""""""

You can get some extra credit for participating on Campuswire_.
Campuswire keeps track of your contributions via a reputation system.
We'll assign extra credit based on that.

You will not get any extra credit if we determine you are gaming contributions to Campuswire.

Class/Office Hours Participation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is up to my and the TAs' discretion.
A good way to start is to make sure we learn your name :).

Surveys
"""""""

There will be two extra credit surveys during the quarter: one in the middle, and one near the end.
The surveys will ask you questions about how you feel about the course and what could be improved.

More information about these will be posted on Canvas.
Complete these and you'll get some extra credit.

Readings and Schedule
----------------------

Textbooks
~~~~~~~~~

The following textbooks are optional:

* *Computer Organization and Architecture* by William Stallings.
* *Digital McLogic Design* by Bryan Mealy and James Mealy.

Problems won't be assigned out of the textbooks; they're just there if you need further reference.
Having them might be helpful, but my lecture notes should be sufficient.

For the Stallings book, the 9th and 10th editions are almost identical in chapter structure.
Get whichever one you can find or is cheaper.
You can find a copy of the Mealy and Mealy book on Canvas_.
See the schedule_ for reading dates for both books.

Schedule
~~~~~~~~

See the official schedule_ on GitHub.
Topics for future dates on the schedule are tentative and subject to change.
