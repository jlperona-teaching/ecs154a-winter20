# DO NOT POST CODE TO PUBLIC FORKS OF THIS REPOSITORY

Public forks with code for the assignments in them will be immediately reported to [OSSJA](https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/).
Creating a public fork is fine; posting code in them is abetting cheating.
Instructional staff will be monitoring them throughout the quarter.

If you want a personal repository to work in, duplicate the repository and make it private instead of creating a public fork.
GitHub has instructions on [how to duplicate a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository).
